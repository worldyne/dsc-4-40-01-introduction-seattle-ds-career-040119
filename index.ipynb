    "The time has come to learn about one of the most exciting and fast-moving areas of data science: Deep Learning! When we talk about deep learning, we talk about (deep) neural networks. You'll learn all about them in this section. You'll also use Python to build (basic) neural networks from scratch.\n",

    "### Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll learn what it means when we talk about neural networks. You'll learn about the essential building blocks like \"layers\", \"nodes\", \"arrows\", \"weights\", \"loss\", \"cost function\", etc. You'll learn that a neural network general consists of several layers, and how a logistic regression model can be represented as a neural network with just one layer. You'll be able to explain what the advantages and disadvantages of using neural networks are, and get an insight of how forward and backward propagation are used in neural networks to minimize the loss and \"optimize\" your neural network.\n",

Additionally, you'll dive deeper into the use of activation functions in neural networks, and look at several candidate activation functions for your deep learning model."
